## About Me

<p align="justify">
I am a Quantitative Social Scientist currently working in the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/dispute-resolution-research-center.aspx">Dispute Resolution Research Center</a> of the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/academics/management-and-organizations.aspx">Management and Organizations Department</a> at the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/">Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University</a>
</p>

<p align="justify">
I use my expertise and experience as a social scientist to identify, and solve, pressing social and organizational problems. To do this effectively I take a methodologically and analytically diverse approach to my work by using, learning, or developing whatever tool is necessary to find the right answers. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
I have published peer-reviewed work using traditional experiments, archival data, organizational field studies, and longitudinal studies. In doing this work I rely on traditional regression-based approaches (e.g., linear regression, multilevel modeling), latent variable modeling (e.g., structural equation models, factor analysis, and latent change score modeling), and psychometrics (e.g., item response theory). I have also dabbled in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I am also an avid semi-professional cyclist; I compete at the highest level across both Canada and the United States on both the road and the velodrome.
