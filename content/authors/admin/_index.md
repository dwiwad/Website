## About Me

<p align="justify">
I’m a Senior Quantitative Researcher on the Research & Analytics team at Slack, where I apply behavioral science principles to understand how people and organizations work and how they can work better. My role sits at the intersection of applied research, product strategy, and data science.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Trained as a social psychologist, I bring an academic foundation to industry research. I use a methodologically diverse approach to tackle complex questions about technology, collaboration, and workplace behavior. Whether it’s designing experiments, analyzing longitudinal survey data, analyzing behavioral data, or building scalable measurement tools, I use whatever methods are best suited to the question at hand.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I have published peer-reviewed work using traditional experiments, archival data, organizational field studies, and My peer-reviewed academic work spans traditional lab experiments, organizational field studies, archival analyses, and multi-wave panel designs. Analytically, I draw from regression-based modeling (e.g., linear and multilevel models), latent variable approaches (e.g., structural equation modeling, factor analysis, and latent change score models), and psychometric techniques (e.g., item response theory). I also occasionally explore machine learning and natural language processing when they serve a specific research goal.
